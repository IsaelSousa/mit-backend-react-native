### How to test application.

To test application you have to change IP Address in **services/queries/apollo.ts** (define your IP Address).  
Access the graphql_server (folder) and run.  

```shell
   npm i && npm run dev
```

With graphql started, you can start the expo application.  

```shell
   npm i && npm run start
```
